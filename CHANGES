* add read_subjectsfile function
* throw exceptions in all places where exit() was still being called. document potentially thrown exceptions in function doc strings.


v0.2.1
------
* Finish API documentation
* Add structs Annot and Colortable with many convenience member functions that model brain parcellations.
* Add support for reading brain surface parcellations from annot files.
* Add example for reading annot files.


v0.2.0
------
* BREAKING: change order of arguments for all functions reading streams.
* BREAKING: rename all sread_ function to read_ and use overloading.
* Add stream-based versions for reading various formats, including MGH. This allows for MGZ support, see examples/read_mgz/.
* Add many new member functions to structs and use them throughout the library
* Add Curv struct and new read_curv function that reads into it.
* BREAKING: rename old read_curv function that reads only the data part to read_curv_data.
* Add write support for labels


v0.1.0
------
* Read and write FreeSurfer per-vertex data from and to binary curv format files (like $SUBJECTS_DIR/surf/lh.thickness).
* Read FreeSurfer brain surface meshes from binary surf format files (like $SUBJECTS_DIR/surf/lh.white).
* Read FreeSurfer ASCII label files (like $SUBJECTS_DIR/label/lh.cortex.label).
* Read and write FreeSurfer 4D volume files (typically 3D voxels + a fourth time/subject dimension) from binary MGH format files (like $SUBJECTS_DIR/mri/brain.mgh or $SUBJECTS_DIR/surf/lh.thickness.fwhm5.fsaverage.mgh).
